## ✨ Built for the AI‑Native Workflow

Every kit is designed from the ground up to be your perfect partner for tools like **Cursor** and **Claude 3.7**.

- **`.cursorrules` Included:** Pre‑configured context files that guide the AI, dramatically reducing hallucinations and keeping your codebase consistent.
- **Modular & Predictable:** Our architecture is structured so AI can confidently refactor or add features without breaking your core business logic.
- **Prompt‑Ready Code:** Clear, well‑commented patterns make it easy to generate new, on‑brand components with simple prompts.

## 🛡️ Built on a Foundation of Security & Trust

We don't just give you a zip file. You get a **system built for production**, incorporating modern security and compliance standards from day one.

- **Security Shield:** Includes guidance for setting up a Cloudflare Worker to create a private channel for vulnerability disclosure.
- **Production-Ready Stack:** Leveraging best‑in‑class tools verified by thousands of developers.

### Core Technology Choices


| Layer | Our Recommendation | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payments & Tax** | **Paddle** or **Stripe** | Global tax compliance (Merchant of Record), fraud protection, and robust APIs. |
| **Authentication** | **Auth.js (v5)** or **Clerk** | Edge‑compatible, secure by default, and framework agnostic. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** / **Supabase** | Rock‑solid relational integrity with powerful tooling that scales from MVP to millions of users. |
| **Email** | **Resend** or **Postmark** | Highest deliverability so your critical transactional emails always land in the inbox. |

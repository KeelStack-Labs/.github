We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the **KeelStack community**, pledge to make participation in our community a **harassment‑free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to building a community where indie hackers, founders, and developers feel safe, respected, and empowered to learn and grow together.

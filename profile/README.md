# ⚓ KeelStack – Ship SaaS Faster with AI‑Assisted Starter Kits

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **KeelStack**! We're building modular, AI‑friendly starter kits to help indie hackers, founders, and freelancers launch production‑ready SaaS products in days, not months.

We're launching soon – and we'd love for you to be part of the journey.

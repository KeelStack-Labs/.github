# .github – KeelStack Organization Health Files

Welcome to the `.github` repository of **KeelStack**! This is a special repository that holds default community health files for all public repositories under the KeelStack organization on GitHub.

## 📌 Purpose

Files stored here are automatically used by GitHub as the default community standards across every repository in our organization – unless a repository overrides them with its own version. This ensures a consistent and welcoming experience for contributors, users, and community members.

## 📂 What’s Inside

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | Our Code of Conduct, based on the Contributor Covenant, sets expectations for respectful and inclusive participation. |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Guidelines for contributing to KeelStack projects – includes how to report bugs, suggest features, and submit pull requests. |
| [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) | Security policy and instructions for reporting vulnerabilities privately. |

Additional files may be added over time (e.g., issue templates, pull request templates, funding information).

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

- **Contributors**: Please follow the guidelines in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) when participating in any KeelStack repository.

- **Maintainers**: If you need to update any of these files, submit a pull request to this repository. Changes will apply organization‑wide once merged.

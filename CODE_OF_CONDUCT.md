**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the involved parties (including unsolicited contact with enforcement leaders) for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

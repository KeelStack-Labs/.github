## 💡 How Can I Contribute?

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug in any KeelStack template:
1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Someone may have already reported it. Quick search saves everyone time.
2.  **Use the Bug Report Template:** It helps us diagnose faster. Please include:
    *   Your environment (e.g., Next.js version, Node version, OS).
    *   Clear steps to reproduce the issue.
    *   What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.
    *   Relevant error logs or screenshots.

### ✨ Suggesting Features
Have an idea for a new "AI-Native" feature?
1.  Check the **Ideas** category in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/keelstack-me/community/discussions/categories/ideas) first—someone else might have had the same thought.
2.  If it's new, create a new discussion. Describe:
    *   **The problem:** What's a pain point for solo founders that this solves?
    *   **The solution:** How do you envision the feature working?
    *   **Why it fits:** How does it align with KeelStack's AI-native, modular philosophy?

### 📚 Improving Documentation
Good documentation is as important as good code. Found a typo? An unclear explanation? A missing example?
*   **Small fixes:** You can suggest a change directly via a pull request on the relevant repository.
*   **Larger improvements:** Open an issue or discussion first to get feedback.

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines
Following these guidelines helps us review and merge your contributions faster.

### 🎨 Code Style & AI-Readiness
*   **Follow Existing Patterns:** Consistency is key. Look at the surrounding code and match its style.
*   **Write for Humans and AI:** Use clear, descriptive variable and function names. Keep functions focused and small. This makes your code easier for both people **and AI assistants (like Cursor/Claude)** to understand and work with.
*   **Comment the "Why," Not the "What":** Explain *why* a piece of logic exists, especially if it's non-obvious. The "what" should be clear from the code itself.

### 💬 Commit Messages
We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standard. This helps automate changelog generation.
*   `feat:` – A new feature (e.g., `feat: add Lemon Squeezy webhook handler`).
*   `fix:` – A bug fix (e.g., `fix: handle Stripe signature timeout`).
*   `docs:` – Documentation only changes.
*   `refactor:` – A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
*   `test:` – Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
*   `chore:` – Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

1.  **Fork the Repository** (for public community tools).
2.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Branch from `main` and give it a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/stripe-webhook-error`, `feat/add-lemon-squeezy`).
3.  **Make Your Changes:** Follow the development guidelines above.
4.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.
5.  **Update Documentation:** If you're changing behavior, update the relevant documentation files or README.
6.  **Submit the Pull Request:**
    *   Fill out the PR template clearly.
    *   Link any related issues (e.g., "Closes #12").
    *   Explain the "why" behind your change – what problem does it solve, and why is this the best approach?
7.  **Review & Iterate:** A maintainer will review your PR. Be open to feedback and make adjustments as needed. This is a collaborative process!

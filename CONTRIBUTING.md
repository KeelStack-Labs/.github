## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in any KeelStack template:

1. **Check existing issues** – someone may have already reported it
2. **Use the issue template** – when creating a new issue, fill out all requested information
3. **Include details**:
   - Your stack and environment (Next.js version, Node version, etc.)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots or error logs

### 💡 Suggesting Features

Have an idea for a new template or feature? We'd love to hear it!

1. **Check the Ideas category** in our Discussions – it may already be suggested
2. **Create a new discussion** in the Ideas category
3. **Describe**:
   - What you're trying to build
   - How this feature would help you
   - Any examples of similar implementations

### 📚 Improving Documentation

Good documentation is crucial. If you find something unclear:

- Fix it directly (if it's a minor typo)
- Open an issue describing what confused you
- Suggest improvements in Discussions

### 💬 Community Participation

Join our Discussions! Help answer questions, share your projects in Show and Tell, and participate in polls. This is how we grow together.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow the existing patterns in the repository
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic, not obvious code
- Keep functions focused and small

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits:

- `feat:` – new feature
- `fix:` – bug fix
- `docs:` – documentation only
- `style:` – code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` – code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` – adding missing tests
- `chore:` – changes to build process, dependencies, etc.

Example: `feat: add Stripe webhook signature verification`

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test edge cases where relevant

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** (for external contributors)
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes**, following the guidelines above
4. **Write or update tests** as needed
5. **Update documentation** if you're changing behavior
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what you've done
7. **Respond to feedback** – we may request changes

For our private templates, we primarily accept 'Feature Requests' via GitHub Discussions. If you have a fix for a private repo, please share the code snippet in a private support email to support@keelstack.me so we can review and merge it into the core product for everyone.

### PR Requirements

- All automated checks must pass
- At least one maintainer review required
- No merge conflicts with `main`

## 🚀 For Template Contributors

If you're interested in creating a new KeelStack template:

1. Start a discussion in the Ideas category
2. Outline what stack you propose and what it includes
3. Get community feedback
4. We'll discuss potential collaboration

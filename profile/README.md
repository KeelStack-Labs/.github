### **Build Your Next Startup, Not Just Boilerplate.**

KKeelStack is a company on a mission to deliver **production-oriented**, modular starter kits architected for the AI-assisted development era.. We provide the essential, professional‑grade plumbing—Auth, Payments, Security, Database — so you can focus more on your unique idea and ship faster while owning all your equity.

KeelStack focuses on providing well-structured starting points. Final quality, security, and compliance depend on how the system is configured, reviewed, and operated.

KeelStack is under active development and evolving in public. Early access will open progressively as each kit reaches production readiness.

## What KeelStack Is — and Is Not

**KeelStack is:**
- A set of production-ready, opinionated starter systems for real SaaS businesses
- Built for founders who want full source ownership and long-term control
- Designed to work *with* AI coding tools, not fight them

**KeelStack is not:**
- A boilerplate zip dump
- A no-code or low-code platform
- A locked SaaS, hosted service, or vendor-controlled runtime
- A tutorial project or demo stack

KeelStack does not claim to be exhaustive, complete, or suitable for every business model.
Each project has unique legal, security, and operational requirements.

## 🚀 What We're Building

### Flagship Focus (In Active Development)

**Next.js Pro SaaS Starter**  
*Next.js 15 · Prisma / Drizzle · Tailwind · Stripe / Paddle*

A production-grade–inspired SaaS foundation covering:
- Authentication and authorization
- Billing, subscriptions, and tax handling
- Secure database patterns
- Email, webhooks, and background workflows

This is the primary focus and will ship first.

---

### Research & Roadmap

These kits are in exploration or early design stages and will progress only after the flagship is stable:

| Kit | Stack | Status |
|----|----|----|
| AI Agent Kit | Python / Node · LangChain · OpenAI | Research |
| Mobile SaaS Starter | React Native · Expo · NativeWind | Roadmap |

Roadmap items reflect current exploration and may change as the project evolves.

## ✨ Built for AI-Assisted Development

KeelStack is architected to work predictably with modern AI coding tools.

- **`.cursorrules` included** — curated context that reduces hallucinations and enforces architectural boundaries
- **Deterministic structure** — clear module boundaries so AI refactors don’t break business logic
- **Prompt-ready patterns** — consistent, readable code that AI tools can safely extend

The goal is simple: let AI accelerate development without introducing hidden risk.

---

## Scope & Responsibility

KeelStack provides **code patterns and system structure**, not hosted services, operational management, or business guarantees.

Each team is responsible for validating, securing, and maintaining their own deployment.
Independent review and testing are strongly recommended before production use.

---

## 🛡️ Security, Ownership & Trust

KeelStack takes a security-first approach to system design.

Security depends on correct usage, configuration, dependency management, and ongoing maintenance. KeelStack aims to reduce common architectural mistakes — not eliminate risk entirely.

- Responsible vulnerability disclosure with a private reporting channel
- Clear security boundaries and access control patterns
- Architected to support auditability, traceability, and handling of real customer data.

We publish and enforce a Security Policy, Code of Conduct, and Contributing Guidelines to ensure long-term trust.

### Core Technology Choices


| Layer | Our Recommendation | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payments & Tax** | **Paddle** or **Stripe** | Global tax compliance (Merchant of Record), fraud protection, and robust APIs. |
| **Authentication** | **Auth.js (v5)** or **Clerk** | Edge‑compatible, secure by default, and framework agnostic. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** / **Supabase** | Rock‑solid relational integrity with powerful tooling that scales from MVP to millions of users. |
| **Email** | **Resend** or **Postmark** | Highest deliverability so your critical transactional emails always land in the inbox. |

#### Third-Party Dependencies

KeelStack builds on widely-used open-source tools and third-party services. Their behavior, availability, and policies are outside our control and evolve independently.

---

## Governance & Accountability

KeelStack operates with published policies covering:
- Security disclosure
- Community conduct
- Contribution standards

These are not placeholders — they are actively enforced and evolve alongside the codebase.
Violations may result in moderation actions, access restriction, or removal from the community.
